To run this notebook, you must first create a kaggle account. This is because the code file I used contain pre-trained models (bert and others) that are available on kaggle. The same notebook can be run in any other platform aswell but you will have to update the commands so that you obtain those models from the other platform (like google colab) but make sure to update the syntax accordingly.
